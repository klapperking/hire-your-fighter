# Hire Your Fighter!

**Note: This project is unfinished and currently not under active development**

*Hire Your Fighter* is a videogame-like 'airbnb-clone' rails application. Instead of flats, you can offer and rent virtual fighters that have various stat-attributes that are randomly assigned.

In the future you will be able to holds fights between users and create a reputation for your fighter, as well as increasing their stats.

## Next steps
  1. Create 'Arena': Simulate fighting between fighter and record winners
  2. Make fighters train-able to increase stats
  3. Get rid of randomized stat-assignment on fighter-creation
  4. Geocode User-Locations and implement Pokemon-Go style arena fighting
